    <p>
      This project explores the complex and often overlooked balance between individual effort and uncontrollable background factors in shaping academic success. By analyzing a dataset of over 6,600 student records—including behavioral, demographic, and environmental variables—we aim to answer two key questions: How much of a student’s performance can be attributed to their own actions? And how much is shaped by factors beyond their control? Through both exploratory analysis and predictive modeling, we reveal the weight each variable carries and provide actionable insights for educators and students.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Correlation Heatmap</h2>
    <img src="images/eda/correlation_heatmap.png" alt="Correlation Heatmap" />
    <p>
      This heatmap illustrates the correlation between all features in the dataset, helping us identify the strength and direction of relationships among variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's visible that attendance and study time are the most dominant factors affecting exam grades, followed by previous scores and access to resources.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Controllable vs. Uncontrollable Factors</h2>
    <img src="images/eda/controllable_vs_uncontrollabe_analyses.png" alt="Controllable vs Uncontrollable Feature Correlation" />
    <p>
      The bar chart visualizes the correlation of controllable features versus uncontrollable features. Red bars indicate uncontrollable features, while green bars indicate controllable ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      While attendance and study time clearly play a major role, the chart shows that when these two are excluded, uncontrollable features—such as access to resources and stronger correlations with exam scores than many other controllable variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      This highlights how environmental background can rival the influence of habits and behaviors students can directly control. As surprisingly as it is, parental involvement showed a negative correlation, indicating families can do more harm than good when acting unconsciously to support their children.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Predictive Modeling</h2>
    <p>
      After identifying key relationships in the data, we move forward to predictive modeling to assess how accurately academic performance can be estimated. Our first approach uses <strong>all available features</strong> in the dataset—both controllable behaviors and uncontrollable background conditions.
    </p>
    <img src="images/eda/lgbm_regression_fit.png" alt="Full Feature LightGBM Model Performance" />
    <p>
      We trained a LightGBM model using all available features.
    </p>
    <p><strong>RMSE:</strong> 1.03<br />
    <strong>R² Score:</strong> 0.89</p>
    <p>
      This model delivers highly accurate predictions by combining behavioral patterns with environmental context. The strong R² score suggests that most of the variance in exam scores can be explained using the available data—highlighting the power of a well-rounded understanding of both effort and environment.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Interpretation of Features</h2>
    <p>
      While predictions were made using LightGBM for its high accuracy, the following feature interpretations are based on coefficients from a Ridge Regression model trained on standardized data. This approach allows for clearer understanding of each variable’s individual contribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most influential features were Attendance (+2.29) and Study Time (+1.71), which had the strongest positive impact on exam performance. These were followed by Previous Scores (+0.69), Access to Resources (+0.68), and Tutoring Sessions (+0.50), all of which reflect consistent academic preparation and support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moderate contributors include Peer Influence, Parental Education Level, Family Income, and Motivation Level all showing meaningful but less dominant positive effects. Interestingly, Parental_Involvement had a negative weight, possibly reflecting reactive support in struggling situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other features such as Physical Activity, Internet Access, and Distance from Home showed smaller positive effects. Features like Teacher Quality, Gender, Sleep Hours, and School Type showed negligible influence on performance in this model.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Environmental-Only Model</h2>
    <p>
      To better understand how much of a student’s success can be explained without behavioral data, we trained a separate model using only uncontrollable, environmental variables—such as family income, parental education, peer influence, and learning disabilities.
    </p>
    <img src="images/eda/lgbm_regression_model2.png" alt="Environmental-Only Model LightGBM" />
    <p><strong>RMSE:</strong> 1.03<br />
    <strong>R² Score:</strong> 0.89</p>
    <p>
      Surprisingly, the model’s predictive power remains just as strong. Even without attendance or study time, background conditions alone can account for nearly 89% of the variance in student performance. This finding reinforces how powerful—and often overlooked—environmental and demographic factors are when it comes to academic outcomes.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Interpretation of Features (Uncontrollable Features)</h2>
    <p>
      As with the previous model, predictions here were made using LightGBM, while the feature importance interpretation is based on coefficients from Ridge Regression. This maintains consistency in interpretability across both models.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Access to Resources (+0.187)</strong>: Students with better access to learning resources perform significantly better, confirming the strong role of infrastructure and opportunity.</p>
    <p><strong>Parental Education Level (+0.128)</strong>: Higher parental education is associated with slightly better performance, likely due to stronger academic support environments.</p>
    <p><strong>Peer Influence (+0.123)</strong>: Students surrounded by academically driven peers tend to stay more engaged and motivated.</p>
    <p><strong>Distance from Home (+0.099)</strong> and <strong>Family Income (+0.096)</strong> also show modest positive correlations with performance, likely linked to time efficiency and access to resources.</p>
    <p><strong>Internet Access (+0.069)</strong>: While not a major factor, digital access still plays a supportive role.</p>
    <p><strong>Parental Involvement (−0.091)</strong> and <strong>Learning Disabilities (−0.109)</strong> both show negative associations. The former may reflect reactive engagement from parents, while the latter highlights well-documented academic challenges.</p>
    <p>Other features like Gender and School Type showed negligible correlation in this model.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      While both hard work and environmental background matter, our results show that <strong>individual effort—particularly attendance and study time—has the strongest influence</strong> on academic success. That said, when stripped of these controllable variables, uncontrollable factors like family background, access to resources, and learning disabilities alone still explained nearly the same amount of variation (R² = 0.89). This suggests that the two forces are not mutually exclusive; success is best understood as a <strong>combination of both</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Predictive models reinforce the importance of attendance, study time, and resource access in student performance. These results provide a clear framework for prioritizing interventions aimed at improving academic outcomes.

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Data-Driven Recommendations for Educators</h2>
    <p><strong>Track and prioritize attendance:</strong><br>
      Since attendance is the most powerful predictor of performance, even slight drops in attendance may signal the need for intervention.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Monitor study time or homework submission frequency:</strong><br>
      Hours studied significantly influence scores. Students who appear disengaged outside of class may benefit from personalized study plans or after-school programs.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Use previous academic performance as a benchmark, not a verdict:</strong><br>
      While past scores are useful, they do not fully determine current outcomes. Students with low prior performance but strong study habits may be on a recovery path.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Help to improve access to learning resources:</strong><br>
      Students with limited access to books, digital tools, or stable environments should be provided with institutional support to level the playing field.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Be aware of peer influence patterns:</strong><br>
      Students who are part of academically disengaged peer groups may require additional encouragement or positive peer modeling.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Watch for students with learning difficulties — even if they have average scores:</strong><br>
      The model shows that learning disabilities are associated with a measurable drop in performance. Early detection and accommodations are essential.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Raise awareness on parental involvement:</strong><br>
      Parental involvement shows a negative correlation, indicating that some parents may be stressing out students even more.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>For Students</h2>
    <p><strong>Show up — consistently:</strong><br>
      Attending classes is not only important for the content, but also for maintaining a student mindset. And remember, they might sound similar, but attendance and attention are not the same.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Study smart, not endlessly:</strong><br>
      Instead of just increasing hours, focus on quality: active recall, focused blocks, and regular review matter most.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Don’t be defined by your past scores:</strong><br>
      Your improvement trajectory is what counts. Use feedback to adjust, not to label yourself.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Ask for help early:</strong><br>
      Especially if you are lacking resources, share it with people who can help you.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Choose your study environment and friends wisely:</strong><br>
      Spend time around people who encourage your goals. Peer effect matters more than you think.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Talk to your parents about what helps and what doesn’t:</strong><br>
      Be open about pressure, expectations, and how they can support you without pressuring you more.
